This will be a very short readme since there ain't much I wanna say. I basically wished to improve upon the structure of my initial implementation (ThesaurusUBC) by making it more efficient 
via hashing, and more usable by adding reflexive relationships between the entries i.e. If a is a synonym of b, b is a synonym of a. This property would be maintained throughout the program.
So you virtually have (in a manner of speaking) essentially, a graph (the thesaurus itself) with fully connected (complete graphs) components.

I paused my implementation of the project since I realized that the ambitious goal this was the precursor to, Semantic Search, (which if you've been scrutinizing my GitHub you will find
referenced elsewhere) is at present beyond my abilities since I wished for the graphs to be self-regulated with a language module which I cannot design (and thereby, rather than shift its 
purpose from pedagogy, potentiate its pedagogical purpose and give it much more utility. 

Rest assured, this will be completed in due time.
